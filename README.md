# 🧱 Low-Level Design (LLD) Project Showcase

Welcome to my **LLD Design Patterns Repository**!
This project is a collection of real-world code implementations that demonstrate core design principles, architectures, and design patterns used in scalable, maintainable software systems.

> 📌 **This repo highlights my understanding of LLD through hands-on implementation of SOLID principles, layered architecture, and a wide range of design patterns.**

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🔹 1. SOLID Principles ⏳

* **Single Responsibility Principle**
* **Open/Closed Principle**
* **Liskov Substitution Principle**
* **Interface Segregation Principle**
* **Dependency Inversion Principle**

### 🔹 2. MVC Architecture

* Clean implementation of **Model-View-Controller** pattern for better modularity and separation of concerns.
