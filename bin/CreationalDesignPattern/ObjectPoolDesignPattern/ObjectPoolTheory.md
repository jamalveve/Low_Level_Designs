## üèä Object Pool Design Pattern in Java

The **Object Pool Design Pattern** is a creational pattern that manages a pool of reusable objects. It optimizes resource usage by reusing objects that are expensive to create instead of creating new ones every time an object is requested.

### ‚ö° What‚Äôs Happening?

An object pool maintains a set of initialized objects ready to use. When a client requests an object, it is provided from the pool if available; otherwise, a new object may be created (up to a maximum limit). Once the client finishes using the object, it returns it back to the pool for future reuse. This reduces costly object creation and garbage collection.

### üõ†Ô∏è Components

#### 1. Pooled Object

The resource-intensive object managed by the pool.

```java
class DatabaseConnection {
    private static int counter = 0;
    private int id;

    public DatabaseConnection() {
        id = ++counter;
        System.out.println("Creating new connection with id: " + id);
    }

    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connection " + id + " connected.");
    }

    public void disconnect() {
        System.out.println("Connection " + id + " disconnected.");
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Object Pool Manager

Maintains available and used objects, controls acquisition and release.

```java
class ConnectionPool {
    private List availableConnections;
    private List usedConnections = new ArrayList<>();
    private static final int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 3;

    public ConnectionPool(List pool) {
        this.availableConnections = pool;
    }

    public synchronized DatabaseConnection getConnection() {
        if (availableConnections.isEmpty()) {
            if (usedConnections.size()  initialPool = new ArrayList<>();
        initialPool.add(new DatabaseConnection());
        initialPool.add(new DatabaseConnection());

        ConnectionPool pool = new ConnectionPool(initialPool);

        DatabaseConnection c1 = pool.getConnection();
        c1.connect();

        DatabaseConnection c2 = pool.getConnection();
        c2.connect();

        System.out.println("Available connections after getting 2: " + pool.getAvailableConnectionsCount());

        pool.releaseConnection(c1);
        System.out.println("Available connections after releasing 1: " + pool.getAvailableConnectionsCount());

        DatabaseConnection c3 = pool.getConnection();
        c3.connect();

        System.out.println("Available connections at end: " + pool.getAvailableConnectionsCount());
    }
}
```

### Generic Object Pool Example

Shows how a pool can manage generic objects with simple acquire/release methods.

```java
class ObjectPool {
    private static final int POOL_SIZE = 2;
    private static List pool = new ArrayList<>(POOL_SIZE);

    static {
        for (int i = 0; i  0) {
            return pool.remove(0);
        } else {
            return new Object();
        }
    }

    public static synchronized void releaseObject(Object obj) {
        pool.add(obj);
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
public class SimpleGenericObject {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj1 = ObjectPool.getObject();
        Object obj2 = ObjectPool.getObject();
        System.out.println("Object 1: " + obj1);
        System.out.println("Object 2: " + obj2);

        ObjectPool.releaseObject(obj1);
        ObjectPool.releaseObject(obj2);

        Object obj3 = ObjectPool.getObject();
        Object obj4 = ObjectPool.getObject();
        System.out.println("Object 3: " + obj3);
        System.out.println("Object 4: " + obj4);
    }
}
```

### üåü Why Object Pool Pattern?

- Improves performance by reusing expensive-to-create objects.
- Manages limited resources efficiently.
- Controls resource usage and prevents resource exhaustion.
- Simplifies client code by encapsulating object lifecycle management.

### üöó Real-World Analogy

A rental car agency maintains a fleet of cars (objects). Customers rent cars if available and return them for others. New cars are purchased only if demand exceeds supply.
