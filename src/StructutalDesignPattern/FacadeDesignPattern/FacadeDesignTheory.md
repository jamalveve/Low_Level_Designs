## üé≠ Facade Design Pattern in Java

The **Facade Design Pattern** is a structural pattern that provides a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem. It shields the client from the complexities of the subsystem and makes the subsystem easier to use.

### ‚ö° What‚Äôs Happening?

The pattern introduces a *facade* class that wraps multiple subsystem classes and exposes a simple interface. Clients communicate only with the facade, which delegates requests to the appropriate subsystem classes internally. This reduces dependencies and simplifies client interaction.

### üõ†Ô∏è Components

#### 1. Subsystem Classes

These are the complex classes that perform specialized tasks.

```java
class AudioPlayer {
    void playAudio(String filename) {
        System.out.println("Playing audio file: " + filename);
    }
}

class VideoPlayer {
    void playVideo(String filename) {
        System.out.println("Playing video file: " + filename);
    }
}

class ImageLoader {
    void loadImage(String filename) {
        System.out.println("Loading image file: " + filename);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Facade Class

Provides a simple interface to the complex subsystem.

```java
class MultimediaFacade {
    private AudioPlayer audioPlayer;
    private VideoPlayer videoPlayer;
    private ImageLoader imageLoader;

    public MultimediaFacade() {
        this.audioPlayer = new AudioPlayer();
        this.videoPlayer = new VideoPlayer();
        this.imageLoader = new ImageLoader();
    }

    public void playMedia(String filename, String mediaType) {
        switch (mediaType.toLowerCase()) {
            case "audio":
                audioPlayer.playAudio(filename);
                break;
            case "video":
                videoPlayer.playVideo(filename);
                break;
            case "image":
                imageLoader.loadImage(filename);
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Unsupported media type: " + mediaType);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Client

Uses the facade to interact with the subsystem in a simple way.

```java
public class MultimediaApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MultimediaFacade facade = new MultimediaFacade();

        facade.playMedia("song.mp3", "audio");
        facade.playMedia("movie.mp4", "video");
        facade.playMedia("picture.jpg", "image");
        facade.playMedia("document.pdf", "document"); // Unsupported type
    }
}
```

### üåü Why Facade Pattern?

- Simplifies usage of complex subsystems by exposing a simple interface.
- Reduces dependencies and coupling between client and subsystem.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.
- Enables flexible subsystem structuring without affecting clients.

### üöó Real-World Analogy

A universal remote control (facade) provides a simple interface to operate many devices (TV, DVD player, sound system) hidden inside a complex home theater system (subsystem).

This explanation uses your example to highlight how the Facade pattern streamlines client interaction with a complex subsystem via a single unified interface.
